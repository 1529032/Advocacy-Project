                <p>Over the past couple of decades, the rise in obesity rates and unhealthy citizens has been very high.</p>
                <p>Many American citizens don't have a lot of time to work on themselves. Whether the reason is because of:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>How busy their schedule is</li>
                    <li>Certain health conditions they were born with</li>
                    <li>Not having access to anything</li>
                    <li>Not knowing where to start</li> 
                </ol> 
                <p>
                    I am here to help with any of those problems. I want to provide plans and show examples of ways to be healthier. I want to give advice to all in order to help as many people as I can.

                <h2 class="link-diet">Dieting</h2>
                <p>Dieting is one of the most important things when it comes to health and fitness. 
                You could exercise as much as you want, but if you're not eating the right foods or eating too much,
                it would be very hard to progress. The main components of a diet come down to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The amount of calories you intake</li>
                    <li>The amount of protein you intake</li>
                    <li>The amount of carbs and fats you intake</li>
                    <li>The types of foods you eat</li> 
                </ol> 
                <p>
                    Being able to track all of these components will help with your health and your fitness journey.
                </p>
                <h4>Dieting Resources</h4>
                <p>There are many resources available. Many influencers have created cookbooks 
                for consumers to use. These cookbooks include all the macros needed so that 
                you can track your diet. My favorite cookbook is from a popular fitness influencer
                named DAMO. Check it out below if you're interested.

                    a humans life drastically. People are busy all the time but if you could take out an hour or even 30 minutes
                    of your day to do a bit of excersising, your life can be improved and you will see change over time. 
                    You might ask, what might some of these benefits are?
